## About This Resource

<a href="https://streamable.com/6r46nm">Preview Resource (Video)</a>

**This resource allows your players to quickly navigate through the server navigation (main) menu.**

All shortcuts can be removed, this menu allows you to open any menu or access anything on the server, by pressing **M** on the keyboard.

Setting up this resource is **not difficult** at all, you need the most basic knowledge of the LUA programming language, and if you do not know what you are doing, ***you can ask for help, which will surely be answered on and you will get help***.

> **Instructions** for setting up this resource can be found in the **SETUP.md** file.

In the upcoming period, various updates will be done on this resource, and some of them are:
* Better and simpler configuration
* Level System connected with this menu
* Shop System connected with this menu
* Job Center connected with this menu
* Report System connected with this menu (used for Administration Contact)
* Make it so there is as less as possible images
* And more...

This resource is **fully responsive**, like any of our other resources that contain NUI.
